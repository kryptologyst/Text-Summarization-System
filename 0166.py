# Project 166. Text summarization using extractive methods
# Description:
# Extractive summarization selects key sentences from the original text to build a concise summary. This project implements extractive summarization using TF-IDF-based sentence scoring and cosine similarity, ranking the most relevant sentences to form a summary.

# Python Implementation: Extractive Text Summarizer (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)
# Install if not already: pip install nltk scikit-learn numpy

# Sample text for summarization

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide. 
It is being used in healthcare to detect diseases early, in finance to prevent fraud, 
and in manufacturing to optimize supply chains. AI-powered assistants are now part of daily life. 
Despite its promise, AI raises ethical concerns like bias and job displacement. 
As AI evolves, regulations and responsible development become crucial.

# Step 1: Split text into sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
 
# Step 2: Vectorize sentences using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
sentence_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)
 
# Step 3: Compute similarity matrix
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(sentence_vectors)
 
# Step 4: Rank sentences using similarity scores
scores = similarity_matrix.sum(axis=1)
 
# Step 5: Select top-N sentences as summary
N = 3
top_sentence_indices = np.argsort(scores)[-N:][::-1]
summary = [sentences[i] for i in sorted(top_sentence_indices)]
 
# Final output

# 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates:
# Uses TF-IDF vectorization to represent sentence importance

# Applies cosine similarity to measure sentence relevance

# Selects top N sentences to form a readable, factual summary
